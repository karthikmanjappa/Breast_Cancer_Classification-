# Wisconsin Breast Cancer Detection Using L1 Logistic Regression. 
##### Abstract: The detection of breast cancer type from the Wisconsin CSV dataset is described in this code. One of the most frequent malignancies in women is breast cancer. An earlier diagnosis will result in the cancer being completely cured.Breast cancer is a prevalent disease among women, and early detection plays a vital role in effective treatment. In this study, a logistic regression model is developed to classify breast tumors as benign or malignant. The Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset is utilized, consisting of various features related to tumor characteristics. The dataset is explored, visualized, and divided into training and testing sets. A logistic regression model is trained and evaluated using accuracy metrics. Finally, the trained model is used to predict the malignancy of a given breast tumor. This study highlights the importance of accurate breast cancer classification and demonstrates the efficacy of logistic regression in achieving this goal.Keywords— breast.

##### It is good accuracy for Wisconsin Breast Cancer Detection.
# Final Thoughts 
#### L1-regularized logistic regression has shown strong potential in breast cancer detection due to its inherent feature selection capability. It helps identify the most important predictors from the dataset, which not only improves interpretability but can also enhance model generalization by reducing overfitting.One of the notable advantages of using L1 regularization in this context is its ability to zero out less important features, leaving only the most critical factors in breast cancer prediction. This leads to a more transparent model where the most relevant risk factors are identified, which can help healthcare professionals better understand the underlying causes of breast cancer. Further exploration could involve comparing L1 logistic regression with other models (such as SVM, decision trees, or deep learning models) to evaluate performance trade-offs, as well as investigating hybrid models that could leverage both interpretability and complex feature interactions.
